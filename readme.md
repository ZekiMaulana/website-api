Quick Setup for this project

This project using HTML, EJS for templating, and CSS for design(still struggle with css but i'm trying my best to implementing what i learn). 
Use JIKAN API and MyAnimeList for data information.

all you need to start this website is install package using "npm i" on terminal in this repo

i really apreciate it if you have some advice for me to increase my skills...

and for the search features has not been added, it's just a decoration :).
my skill not enough yet or i'm just not using the correct keyword to search for the answer on internet OR MAYBE it takes me too long to do this project so i just skip it and  comeback another time to fixed it hopefully.

funfact: there's lot a times i was just thinking how can i make the design to be exactly like what i want using my own css,
         i was using flex and grid, when i was modified css to make it work on mobile size, i just realize that i can use bootstrap row column for flexibility instead define it one by one on my own.

hope you enjoyy
